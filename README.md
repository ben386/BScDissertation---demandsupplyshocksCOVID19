"Decomposing Demand and Supply Shocks under COVID-19 Volatility" by Benjamin O'Sullivan. 

+--------------------------------------------+

I estimate the contributions of demand and supply shocks on US
real output growth fluctuations during the COVID-19 pandemic. A time-varying
vector autoregressive model proposed by Lenza & Primiceri (2020) is used to
describe the joint dynamics of real output growth and inflation. The demand and
supply shocks are uncovered using a long-run identification scheme. Conducting
a historical decomposition of the structural model, I find that supply shocks were
more influential in driving real output growth fluctuations relative to demand
shocks during the early stages of the pandemic. These findings are in contrast to
certain studies that point towards demand dynamics playing a more prominent
role in determining the substantial reductions in output during the COVID-19
episode.
